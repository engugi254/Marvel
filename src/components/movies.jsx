        <p>
          The MCU started when Tony Stark became Iron Man. The 2008 “Iron Man”
          movie showed Tony Stark trapped in a cave in the Middle East, with the
          only survival tactic being to create an artificial heart using
          nanotechnology. That helped him become Iron Man and set the course for
          the future MCU.
